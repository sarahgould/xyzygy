## TO-DO
- better mobile support

## STRETCH GOALS
- behavior
    - more variety of behaviors in general
    - feeding aliens more makes them more friendly
    - variety in movement types (like tadpoles, move in pulses)
    - different plants grow, and aliens like different types of plants
    - aliens react to other flocks
    - communication
        - aliens talk at you
        - their speech is decoded when you become friends
        - they tell you about their planet, their culture, their lives
    - colonial expansion
        - when you give an alien a gift, they have the ability to colonize an empty planet
            - maybe one (random) alien becomes a 'queen' and explores nearby planets
        - that planet then becomes a homeworld for a new batch of aliens
    - some aliens are lone wanderers
    - some aliens glitch-phase in and out of existence
        - if you give them a gift, they drop something cool
- gameplay
    - you can leave beacons to fast-travel back to that sector
    - you get a map or something at the end, showing planets you visited and aliens you befriended
    - keyboard controls
- better performance on Firefox
- procedural soundtrack and/or sound effects
